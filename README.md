Challenge 12 - nosql_challenge

## Background
The Eat, Safe, Love editors have asked me to evaluate various food establishments for their magazine. After importing the JSON file, I got the file ready by updating a new establishment and making sure all the fields were stored correctly. Next, I started to analyze the data with specific questions from the magazine.  

1.  There are 41 establishments that have a hygiene score equal to 20.  
2.  There are 29 establishments in London with a rating of 4 or higher. 
3.  The top 5 establishments with a rating value of 5 and the lowest hygiene score near Penang Flavours are:

### Soucres:
1. https://github.com/yeyanwang/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_analysis.ipynb - I struggled to get the formula to allow me to find the longitude and latitude that would help me retrieve the top 5 closest establishments to that area. I used this code to help me complete this part of the homework.
